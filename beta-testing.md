# Beta-Testing
(added this a little late, had it recorded in another document)

## Non-programmer's advice:
- Add some sound effects 
- "Why is the background not moving?"
- The health bar and heart system looks very good
- The fireball is not coming out from the mouth of the flying bat
- "Why do I die instantly when I touch the mushroom enemy?"
- "why is there no 'how to play?' section?"
- Add home and end screen menus 

## Programmer's advice:
- The background is blank. A parallax effect would help 
- Correct the hitbox and timeout of the fireball so that it matches with the enemy's animation
- Optimize the code and remove unnecessary extra variables etc.
- I'm sticking to the enemy, so change the collision system and add damage timeout so that the player doesn't instantly take so much damage.
- The jump boost is getting dragged with the mushroom enemy. Change the collision system between the two to fix this.

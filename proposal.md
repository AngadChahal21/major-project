# Major Project Proposal

## Description
For my major project, I will developing a 2d platformer game inspired by the Super Mario games where the player will jump around platforms, dodge enemy attacks and kill them, collecting power-ups/abilities and coins approaching the end of the level. 

## Needs to have list
- **A Physics Engine**: to implement realisitic gravity required for jumping, sliding, and falling down from plaforms, 
- **A Basic power-up**: that actually increases the health of the player
- **Location tracking enemies**: that attack using projectiles depending on where the player is
- **Atleast 3 characters:** to choose as the main player skin.
- **Basic Sound**: to make the game more engaging with player sounds/ enemy attacking sounds, background music, jumping sounds etc.
- **Efficient collision detection system**: to detect collisions of bullets(projectiles) of enemies with the player and vice a versa


## Nice to have list
- **Advanced Movement**: like sliding and wall jumping
- **Dynamic Platforms**: with rotation, horizontal and vertical movement to make the game more challenging.
- **Checkpoint system**: Allowing the player to respawn at checkpoints after dying 
- **Parallax effect**: to create more depth in the game 
- **Polished Lobbies**: Modern looking lobbies and store for buying skins, with smooth and eye appeasing User Interface
- **Abilities**: Actual abilities like fire, ice and flying using power-ups apart from the basic health increasing one.

# Major Project Proposal

## Description
For my major project, I will be developing a 2d platformer game inspired by the Super Mario games where the player will jump around platforms, dodge enemy attacks and kill them, collecting power-ups/abilities and coins as it approaches the end of the level(s). The attempt is at using basic elements from the super mario games along with some tinges of originality and features from different 2d precision platformer games.  

## Needs to have list
- **A Physics Engine**: to implement realisitic gravity required for jumping, falling down from plaforms and some projectile attacks(like fireballs, if implemented)
- **A Basic power-up**: that actually increases the health of the player
- **Atleast one type of location tracking enemies**: that attack using bullets/arrows depending on where the player is
- **Atleast 3 characters:** to choose as the main player skin.
- **Basic Sound**: to make the game more engaging with player sounds, enemy attacking sounds, background music, jumping sounds etc.
- **Efficient collision detection system**: to detect collisions of enemy attacks with the player and vice a versa
- **A clean and functioning scoring system**: which displays the player's statistics like coins collected, currently activated ability, time-tracker and number of lives left 
- **Checkpoint system**: Allowing the player to respawn at checkpoints after dying 

## Nice to have list
- **Advanced Movement**: like sliding, wall jumping(dashing), picking up objects, etc.
- **Dynamic Platforms**: with rotation, horizontal and vertical movement to make the game more challenging.
- **Parallax effect**: to create more depth in the game 
- **Polished Lobbies**: Modern looking lobbies and store for buying skins, with smooth and eye appeasing User Interface
- **Abilities**: Actual abilities like fire, ice and flying using power-ups apart from the basic health increasing one.
- **Final Boss Fight**: A boss fight at the end of the level(s) where the 'boss' is more interactive with the player and is smater in dodging and attacking.
- **A mini map**: that tells me where I am in the level
- **A Two-Player functionality**: An attempt to integrate multiplayer functionality in the game.

# Major Project Reflection

## "what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again or make a similar project in the future?"

- Firstly, something that I did for the first time is, creating a complete outline for a project with lists of the required and desired elements in the project. I feel it made it very clear for me to follow a roadmap and not waste time in brainstorming ideas in the midst of making the project. This is something I would definitely carry on into all of my future projects
- Distribute time wisely and set your priorities. Do not prioritize spending time working on something that is not essential for your project to stand out, over something that is. 
- For future projects, always keep a deadline in mind. Working without a time constraint will lead to inconsistency and no clear vision in mind. For this project, I believe the fixed time constraint of 2 months that was announced right at the start of the project, was a driving force for me to continue working consistently. 

## did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?

- Yes, all the pointers in the 'needs to have' list have been accomplished. Talking about the 'nice to have' list, I've accomplished four out of the nine pointers I had in my proposal document.
- I have a few elements that I didn't necessarily have on the needs-to-have or the nice-to-have list, some being things like, the mushroom enemy, or a health bar.

## What was the hardest part of the project?

- I would say, firstly, learning my way about p5 play itself was challenging. However, something specific that I spend a lot of time trying to problem solve was building the moving platform. Making the constraints/limits of the platform was quite a challenge. I spend a lot of time trying to debug, find fixes online, and brainstorming new approaches for making these constraints. The first obvious way of making constraints would be to store the initial location of the block and add and subtract a value to make the limits, which for some reason didn't seem to work, even if I set the initial location to a constant variable. Secondly, I tried to make it work using collisions, by creating a whole new group of invisble barrier blocks that would act as limits, however due to collider type issues, that didn't work either. Finally, I had to settle with a time constraint to switch the direction of the block

- Basically, what my takeaway from this experience was that, knowing how to debug, problem-solve and finding different ways out for the same problem is very important for a project to be a success. It is perfectly fine to try different approaches to problems that are not getting solved the conventional way

## Were there any problems you could not solve?

- There are currently no bugs that break the game entirely or ruin the experience of the game. The game, currently the way it is, works works very well except a few things
- For example, there is a friciton problem that I am facing. The problem is that the player sticks to the side of walls/blocks and makes a game a slight bit annoying sometimes. However, it is not something that I've spent a lot of time fixing. It is a bug that I didn't feel deserved attention during the time other elements that were vital to the game to function well and be visually appealing, had been to added and improved.
- Other than that, I would say there are some minor problems, that the mushroom enemy, just topples over and gets dragged along the player if hit aggressively.
